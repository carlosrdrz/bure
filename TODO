- create dir in personal folder for configs and files
- add service locator (otherwise it will be more difficult to test)
- tests
- maybe should use enum for sprites IDs instead of strings
- layer management is very poor. need to improve it.
- add all dependencies to the repo instead of expecting people to install them on their package managers
- extract sprite management from engine
- entity builder
- ui needs to be easier to modify
- consider adding some scripting engine to modify stuff like UI, some entity-specific properties, dialogues, etc
- it makes no sense that bure::game_map knows which tiles are walkable based on the layers
- animations, coords, ui... everything that is a number or property can go either in a XML or a JS file
