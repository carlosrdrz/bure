- maybe should use enum for sprites IDs instead of strings
- maybe should move declarations of types like rect to their own files

- remove all hardcoded constants. specially in the map rendering process.
- maybe add all dependencies to the repo instead of expecting people to install them on their package managers
- extract sprite management from engine
- entity builder
