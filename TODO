- create dir in personal folder for configs and files
- move maps and images to resources
- add service locator (otherwise it will be more difficult to test)
- tests
- maybe should use enum for sprites IDs instead of strings
- finally remove graphics and rename graphics2
- move all initialization to engine so that callers don't care about internals
- work on entities
- maybe should move declarations of types like rect to their own files
- layer management is very poor. need to improve it.
